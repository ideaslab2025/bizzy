            <p className="text-lg mb-4">
              While our guidance is professionally informed and quality-assured, it remains guidance under UK law rather than regulated advice. This distinction is important under UK law as it means:

              <li>We connect you directly to relevant government services and other services and walk you through the requirements of what you need to do, step by step, category by category, department by department.</li>
              <li>We explain each process with interactive short videos, guided text, and clear next steps, through our Bizzy platform.</li>
